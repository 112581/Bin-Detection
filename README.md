# Bin-Detection
Detected Medical bins and images and applied Google OCR to help detect what was in each bin.
Ran Yolov3 Algorithm to detect position and size of bins and then used Google OCR to detect QR codes on each bin to detect what drugs resided in each bin. I then used this data to help plan how to rearrange drug placement in bins on a storage shelf.
